    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.proposal_issued_to_1__c}, 

Have you given any additional consideration to my proposal about {!Opportunity.Name}? I’d be happy to speak with you and answer any questions that may have come up. 

If you have any questions specifically about the fees that engineering companies typically charge, you might find the information here useful:

Please let me know if there is a time we can speak. 

Thank you! 
{!Opportunity.Sales_Head__c}, Principal
