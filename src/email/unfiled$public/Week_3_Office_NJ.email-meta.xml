    <subject>Touching Base – Proposal Status</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.proposal_issued_to_1__c},

I recently reached out to you regarding the status of the proposal {!Opportunity.Name}. I understand that you’re busy and may not have had some time to review the information just yet. Part of that uncertainty can be surrounding the specific challenges associated with {!Opportunity.Market_Sector__c} projects.  New Jersey Engineers has completed numerous projects in this domain.

If you have any questions about the proposal please call us at 973.928.0343.

Have a great day!

Regards,
{!Opportunity.Sales_Head__c},
Principal
