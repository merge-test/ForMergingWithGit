    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.proposal_issued_to_1__c},

I recently reached out to you regarding the status of the proposal {!Opportunity.Name}. I understand that you’re busy and may not have had some time to review the information just yet. Part of that uncertainty can be surrounding contractor decisions.

We discuss how to choose the best contractor for your job here:

Have a great day!

Regards,
{!Opportunity.Sales_Head__c}, Principal
