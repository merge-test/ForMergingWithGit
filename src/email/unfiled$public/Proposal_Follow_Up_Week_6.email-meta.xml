    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.proposal_issued_to_1__c},

It’s been over a month since I sent you a proposal for the scope of work we’ve discussed.  Do you have any questions I can help clarify on the proposal?  I’m here to help move forward with the project in any way I can. Communication always helps further develop a clear scope of work.

This blog article that I wrote listed helps describe the engineering process a bit more in depth, from the beginning to the end:

Please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you!
