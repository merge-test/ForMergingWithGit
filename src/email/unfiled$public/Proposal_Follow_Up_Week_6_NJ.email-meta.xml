    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.proposal_issued_to_1__c}, 

It’s been over a month since I sent you a proposal for the scope of work we’ve discussed. Do you have any questions I can help clarify on the proposal? I’m here to help move forward with the project in any way I can. Communication always helps further develop a clear scope of work. 

This blog article that I wrote listed helps describes meeting the New Jersey Energy Code in Commercial and Large Residential Buildings:

Please contact me at your earliest convenience. 

Thank you!
